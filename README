DML -> Data Manipulation Language

-- Objective :- 

The purpose of this task is to get hands-on experience with **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** operations in SQL. Practice and understand inserting, updating, and deleting data, as well as handling special cases like `NULL` values and using `DEFAULT` constraints.

-- Tools Used :- 
MySQL Workbench – Used for executing and testing SQL queries.

-- Key Concepts :-

-- What is DML?
   DML (Data Manipulation Language) refers to SQL commands that are used to manipulate data stored in a database. 

The main DML statements are :-
`INSERT` – Adds new records to a table.
`UPDATE` – Modifies existing records.
`DELETE` – Removes records from a table.

-- What is NULL in SQL?
`NULL` represents a **missing or unknown value**.
It is **not equal to 0 or an empty string**.
You can use `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` to check for NULL values.

-- DEFAULT Constraint :-
- A "default" value is automatically assigned to a column when no value is provided.
- Helps in avoiding NULLs for columns where a common value is expected.


NULL vs 0 :- NULL = unknown or missing, 0 = known number 
DEFAULT Constraint :- Auto-fills a value if none is given 
IS NULL :- Checks if a column contains NULL 
Partial Insert :- Insert only selected columns 
NOT NULL Field :- Must provide a value; otherwise, error 
Rollback DELETE :- Use `ROLLBACK` inside a transaction 
INSERT Using SELECT :- Copy data from one table to another 
ON DELETE CASCADE :- Automatically delete child records when parent is deleted
